# Splynek changelog

A condensed one-line-per-release log. For details, see the relevant
`## What's new in v0.N` section in [README.md](README.md).

## v1.3 — Sovereignty catalog x2 + AI fallback (2026-04-24)

Same-day follow-up release focused on making the Sovereignty tab
more useful for more people.

**Catalog expansion — 50 → 90 entries.** New categories:

- **Browsers** — Arc (US), Opera (Chinese-majority-owned since 2016).
- **Mail/calendar** — Superhuman (US), HEY (US), Notion Calendar (US).
- **Tasks & project management** — OmniFocus, TickTick (CN),
  Microsoft To Do, Asana, ClickUp, Trello (Atlassian/AU),
  monday.com (IL), Jira + Confluence (Atlassian/AU), Basecamp.
- **Launcher / window mgmt** — Raycast, Magnet, Moom. Recommend
  Rectangle (OSS), Amethyst (OSS), Alfred (UK), LaunchBar (Austria).
- **Dev / terminal** — Warp, Nova, BBEdit, Transmit, Navicat (HK).
- **Media & streaming** — Plex, Emby → Jellyfin (OSS). Riverside,
  Descript → Audacity (OSS).
- **VPN** — NordVPN, ExpressVPN → ProtonVPN (CH), Mullvad (SE).
- **System utilities** — iStat Menus (AU), Amphetamine (US),
  Steam (US), Adobe Acrobat Pro.
- **AI tools** — Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot → Mistral Le Chat
  (France), LM Studio (OSS).

Every new entry has a properly-set `targetOrigin` (US / CN / RU /
OTHER) and 1–2 European or open-source alternatives with proper
license + country notes.

**Stable download URLs for more alternatives:** Thunderbird joins
Firefox in the list of alternatives with one-click "Install"
buttons.  Both leverage Mozilla's stable redirect service
(`download.mozilla.org/?product=…-latest&os=osx&lang=en-US`).

**New: AI fallback for uncataloged apps.** Scans occasionally turn
up apps that aren't in the handwritten catalog.  v1.3 adds a
collapsed disclosure at the bottom of the scan results —
"Apps we don't know yet (N)" — that expands to list up to 25 of
them.  Each has an **Ask AI** button that calls the local LLM with
a focused system prompt (European or open-source suggestions only,
never US/CN/RU, include homepage URLs when confident).  Results
render inline.

Caveats documented in the UI + the post-mortem:
- The 3B on-device model occasionally still suggests US alternatives
  despite the prompt.  Users should verify.
- AI-fallback is Pro-only (gated behind `vm.aiAvailable`).  Free-tier
  users see the catalog-based section but no AI fallback button.
- No probe validation on AI suggestions — we're showing project
  names + homepage URLs, not starting downloads.

## v1.2 — Sovereignty + smarter Concierge (2026-04-24)

**New tab: Sovereignty.** Splynek now scans your Mac's installed apps
locally and shows which ones are controlled from outside the European
Union, with European or open-source alternatives where they exist.

Framing is deliberately **pro-sovereignty, not anti-any-country**. An
app controlled from the US and an app controlled from China sit in
the same bucket from an EU user's perspective: both place control
outside the Union. The tab shows each app's country-of-origin as a
neutral grey badge (US / CN / RU / OTHER) so users see *where control
sits* — we inform, we don't shame — then recommend European or
open-source alternatives because those are the two buckets that
most reduce non-EU dependence.

What's in the launch:

- **Local-only scanner** — enumerates `/Applications`,
  `/Applications/Utilities`, and `~/Applications` via FileManager +
  `Bundle(url:)`. No Spotlight daemon access, no network calls, no
  telemetry, no persistence across launches. Sandbox-legal under
  MAS without any special entitlement. The scanner is
  [open-source in this repo](Sources/SplynekCore/SovereigntyScanner.swift)
  with an audited privacy contract at the top of the file.
- **Seed catalog** — ~50 hand-written entries covering the common
  non-European apps users have on their Macs. Browsers (Chrome,
  Edge, Brave, Yandex), communication (Slack, Zoom, Teams, Discord,
  WhatsApp, Messenger, WeChat, QQ, DingTalk, Webex, Tencent Meeting,
  TikTok), productivity (Office, OneNote, WPS, Notion, Evernote,
  Airtable), creative (Adobe CC + per-app, Figma), dev (VS Code,
  GitHub Desktop, Postman, Docker, Sublime, Sourcetree), cloud
  (Drive, Dropbox, Box, Baidu Netdisk), passwords (1Password,
  LastPass, Dashlane), AI (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude Desktop), and
  security (Kaspersky, Avast, Yandex).
- **Origin taxonomy** with an `isRecommendable` invariant — catalog
  targets never use European or OSS origins, and catalog alternatives
  never use US / CN / RU. A US app suggested as an "alternative" to
  another US app wouldn't help.
- **One-click Install** for alternatives with stable direct-download
  URLs (Firefox at launch; community PRs expand). Clicking Install
  hands the URL to Splynek's own download engine — multi-interface
  aggregation, SHA-256 verification, the full stack.
- **Filter chips**: All alternatives / European only / Open-source
  only.
- **Community contributions** — [SOVEREIGNTY-CONTRIBUTING.md](SOVEREIGNTY-CONTRIBUTING.md)
  documents the schema, invariants, design principles, and PR
  submission flow.

**Concierge improvements:**

- **Regex short-circuit for obvious cancel/pause commands.** Cancel,
  stop, abort, kill, halt, pause, suspend, hold, freeze — with or
  without a direct object — now bypass the AI entirely. What took
  10–17 s on the on-device 3B model now takes microseconds.
- **Apple Intelligence prewarm on input-focus** — ~1–2 s off the
  first-response cold start, without paying the model-residency
  cost for users who just peek.

**Under the hood:**

- Architecture invariant #11 in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) documents
  the load-bearing patterns for SwiftUI NavigationSplitView detail
  panes on macOS 26 (GeometryReader + dedicated ObservableObjects +
  MainActor-isolated @Observable system types).
- [POSTMORTEM-Concierge-Blank.md](POSTMORTEM-Concierge-Blank.md)
  from v1.1.1 remains the canonical reference for those patterns.

No user-facing behaviour change for existing Downloads / Queue /
Recipes / Concierge flows. Only additions.

## v1.1.1 — Concierge blank-state hotfix (2026-04-23)

**P0 fix.** v1.1 shipped with a macOS 26 SwiftUI regression that blanked
the entire Concierge split view the first time a user clicked a
suggestion chip (both sidebar and detail pane vanished, only the
toolbar chrome survived). Three combined changes fix it — all of them
required, removing any one lets the bug come back:

- **`GeometryReader` wrap on `ConciergeView.body`** pins the detail
  column to the parent's offered width, breaking the bottom-up
  intrinsic-size propagation that was collapsing the column when the
  transcript flipped from `emptyState` (intrinsic ∞) to `ScrollView`
  (intrinsic ≈ bubble width).
- **Dedicated `ConciergeState: ObservableObject`** holds `chat` +
  `thinking` so mutations re-render only `ConciergeView` — not Sidebar
  and RootView too. The simultaneous three-view re-render was what
  turned a local collapse into a window-wide blank.
- **`@MainActor AppleIntelligenceDriver` enum** wraps
  `LanguageModelSession` per Apple's WWDC25 sessions 286 / 259 / 301.
  Keeps `Observation.Observable` notifications on MainActor so SwiftUI
  can narrow invalidation to the specific leaves.

Full post-mortem with the four dead-end paths we chased first, the
clinching diagnostic, and six rules-of-thumb for NavigationSplitView
detail panes on macOS 26: [POSTMORTEM-Concierge-Blank.md](POSTMORTEM-Concierge-Blank.md).

No user-facing behaviour change other than "the Concierge works now."
No free-tier impact — the free DMG has never included the Concierge;
this only affects Pro / MAS builds.

## v1.1 — Apple Intelligence Concierge (2026-04-21)

**Strategy Bet S1 shipped** — the AI Concierge + Recipes now run on
**Apple's on-device Foundation Models** on macOS 26+, falling back
to LM Studio / Ollama on older hardware.

What changed:

- **Zero-install AI.** On any M-series Mac with Apple Intelligence
  enabled in Settings, the Concierge and Recipes work out of the
  box — no Ollama, no LM Studio, no model download. Inference runs
  on the Neural Engine (ANE) through Apple's `FoundationModels`
  framework shipped in macOS 26 (Tahoe).
- **Three-tier provider detection.** At launch, `AIAssistant.detect()`
  tries Apple Intelligence first, then LM Studio on :1234, then
  Ollama on :11434. Whichever is ready wins. If none are, the
  Concierge / Recipes tabs show three onboarding cards side-by-side
  (Apple Intelligence → Open Settings; LM Studio / Ollama → Install).
- **Transport-agnostic chat completion.** `chatCompletion()` now
  dispatches to either the in-process Foundation Models path or the
  existing HTTP `/v1/chat/completions` path based on the current
  provider. All upper-layer callers (resolveURL, searchHistory,
  generateRecipe, concierge) remain unchanged.
- **Compiles cleanly on older Xcode.** `#if canImport(FoundationModels)`
  guards the new code path so the SPM build still works on Xcode
  versions without the macOS 26 SDK — in that case Splynek gracefully
  falls through to the HTTP providers.
- **New Provider raw value** `"Apple Intelligence"` surfaces in the
  Concierge footer ("Using Apple on-device model via Apple
  Intelligence"), giving users a clear signal that their data isn't
  leaving the Mac.

Privacy positioning: Apple markets Apple Intelligence as strictly
on-device. That's now Splynek's AI story too — no telemetry, no
account, no cloud, no model download. Kills the "I have to install
Ollama first" friction for the vast majority of Apple-Intelligence-
eligible users.

## v1.0 — Launch (2026-04-21)

First stable release. Same binary as v0.50.4 with the marketing
version bumped to 1.0 for the Mac App Store submission.

What's in the launch build:

- **Multi-interface download engine.** Wi-Fi + Ethernet + iPhone
  tether bonded via `IP_BOUND_IF` into a single pipe with adaptive
  lane stats, per-host caps, cellular-aware scheduling.
- **Verified downloads.** SHA-256 checksums + Gatekeeper signature
  introspection for `.dmg`/`.pkg`. Failed verification doesn't move
  the file out of quarantine.
- **LAN cache + fleet.** Bonjour-advertised peers share completed
  downloads over the LAN. No cloud, no account. Free-tier is
  loopback-only; Pro opens it to the LAN.
- **BitTorrent v2.** Native libtorrent-rasterbar 2.x integration
  with session restore, choking, tit-for-tat, magnet + metalink.
- **Local-AI Pro tier** (Mac App Store only) — `$29` one-time:
  - **Concierge**: chat-first control — "download the latest
    Ubuntu ISO", "cancel everything", "find that iOS SDK". Routes
    through LM Studio or Ollama on your Mac.
  - **Agentic Recipes**: plain-English goals → multi-step download
    plans you review + queue in one click.
  - **Scheduled Downloads**: time-window + weekday + cellular-pause
    policy.
  - **LAN-exposed Fleet + iPhone pairing**: scan-a-QR web dashboard
    on your phone, paste URLs from its share sheet.
- **Integrations**: Alfred workflow, Chrome + Safari browser
  extensions (DMG only), Raycast commands, Spotlight intents,
  URL-scheme + CLI.
- **Native macOS**: Universal 2 (Apple Silicon + Intel), sandboxed
  MAS build, hardened runtime + notarised DMG, macOS 13+.
- **Pre-launch polish** (cumulative from v0.47 → v0.50.4):
  borderless app icon, PRO tags on upsells, LM Studio + Ollama
  hybrid detection, Concierge/Recipes full-bleed upsells,
  consolidated `info@splynek.app` contact address, website
  rewrite at splynek.app.

## v0.50.4 — Contact-email consolidation (2026-04-21)

- **All contact addresses now point to `info@splynek.app`.** Prior
  docs + in-app strings referenced `paulo@`, `support@`, `legal@`,
  and `privacy@` mailboxes that were never provisioned. Only the
  `info@` address (the DSA trader declaration contact) actually
  receives mail. Updated in: `docs/pro.html`, `docs/support.html`,
  `docs/privacy.html`, in-app Legal tab button + label
  (`LegalView.swift`), shipped EULA/AUP/PRIVACY markdown bundles
  (`Resources/Legal/*.md`), `MAS_LISTING.md`, and the `README.md`
  description of the Legal-tab contact button. The only remaining
  `*@splynek.app` is `test@splynek.app` — a deterministic unit-test
  fixture, not a real mailbox.

## v0.50.3 — Borderless app icon + PRO tag on AI-URL card (2026-04-20)

- **App icon: white tile removed.** The colored "S" glyph now fills
  the icon edge-to-edge with transparent corners, following the same
  "silhouette icon" pattern Apple uses for letter-mark brands. The
  prior build rendered the glyph at ~84 % of a rounded white tile,
  which read as "small logo on a white card" at Dock size.
- **PRO pill on the Downloads "Describe downloads in plain English"
  card.** The card was always a Pro upsell but the copy ("Install
  Ollama to type… Runs locally — free") hid that fact. Now shows an
  explicit "PRO" tag next to the title, clarified copy that names
  both LM Studio + Ollama as the local-LLM providers, and a button
  that goes to splynek.app/pro instead of ollama.com — so users who
  click aren't surprised when Ollama alone doesn't unlock the feature.

## v0.50.2 — Free-tier Concierge/Recipes upsell rewrite (2026-04-20)

- **Concierge and Recipes tabs are no longer visually empty in the
  free DMG.** The previous stubs rendered a small `ProLockedView`
  card pinned to the top-leading corner, which on a wide window got
  lost in blank space and read as a broken tab. Rewrote both stubs
  to mirror the Pro build's locked-state pitch: centred gradient
  glyph, bold title, four value bullets, "$29 on the Mac App Store"
  CTA. Covers the full detail column, matches the design of the
  Pro build's pre-unlock state, and stays on-brand with the
  `.windowBackgroundColor` + `navigationTitle` other tabs set.

## v0.50.1 — Concierge sidebar fix + amplified app icon (2026-04-20)

- **Concierge no longer collapses the sidebar.** The outer VStack
  now claims `maxWidth/maxHeight: .infinity`; without that, the
  empty-chat Pro state (no PageHeader, 440-px-wide onboarding cards)
  gave NavigationSplitView an intrinsic width too narrow to satisfy
  the detail column's `min: 640`, so the split auto-hid the sidebar.
- **App icon glyph enlarged.** The colored "S" inside the icon tile
  was filling only ~35 % of the canvas, which read as "tiny logo
  floating in a white square" at Dock size. Re-rendered the iconset:
  auto-trimmed the glyph's bounding box, scaled it to ~84 % of the
  1024-px canvas, composited onto a rounded-rect white tile with
  transparent outer corners (macOS app-icon convention). Rebuilt
  .icns; refreshed docs/icon-256.png + docs/icon-1024.png.
- **Hero logo now actually transparent.** The embedded-JPEG source
  under the Canva SVG was bleeding white; color-keyed it out so
  `docs/logo-transparent.png` renders with a true RGBA-transparent
  background against the dark site.

## v0.50 — LM Studio support + marketing-site rewrite (2026-04-19)

- **LM Studio + Ollama hybrid.** `AIAssistant` now probes both
  `localhost:1234` (LM Studio) and `localhost:11434` (Ollama) in
  parallel at launch, picking whichever answers first. All LLM calls
  route through a single `chatCompletion(...)` helper that speaks
  OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions` format — native for LM Studio,
  supported by Ollama since 0.1.14. Same code path for URL resolution,
  history search, Recipes, and Concierge.
- **New Provider enum.** `Provider { .ollama, .lmStudio }` carries
  per-provider URLs (chat, models list, download page). State shape
  changes to `.ready(provider:model:)` — the VM surfaces both so the
  Concierge empty state can show "Using llama3.2:3b via LM Studio".
- **Dual-provider onboarding UI.** Concierge empty state + Recipes
  `aiMissingCard` now show two cards — LM Studio ("EASIEST", green)
  and Ollama ("LIGHTER", blue) — each with a one-click install button
  and a shared "Check again" refresh. Prior copy assumed every user
  would `ollama pull llama3.2:3b` from a terminal, which landed badly
  with non-technical testers.
- **pro.html / support.html / privacy.html restyled.** Extracted the
  v0.49 inline CSS into `docs/splynek.css` and rebuilt each supporting
  page on the same card-panel + page-hero grammar as the landing page.
  Privacy page lede now calls out LM Studio alongside Ollama as a
  non-cloud LLM option.

## v0.49 — UX overhaul + new logo (2026-04-19)

- **Sidebar reordered ASK → ACTIVE → LIBRARY.** Pro-discovery tabs
  (Concierge, Recipes) now sit above the fold. `Settings`, `Legal`,
  `About` moved out of the sidebar into the macOS menu bar — Apple
  menu → About / Settings… (⌘,) and Help menu → Legal…. Sidebar
  ends with a compact "Welcome to Splynek" brand footer so first-
  paint still carries the wordmark.
- **New logo.** Canva-authored Splynek mark replaces the v0 glyph
  everywhere — in-app `.icns`, docs/icon-{256,1024}.png, the website
  hero, Pro-tab empty states.
- **Website landing rewrite.** Gradient hero with 144pt mark,
  "Use every network, at once." headline, proof bars (38 MB/s Wi-Fi
  vs 117 MB/s Splynek), 6-card feature grid, Pro teaser panel,
  closing CTA. Shrunk the QR panel on the in-app Web Dashboard tab
  (170 → 110 px).

## v0.48 — Pro tab discovery (2026-04-19)

- **Concierge + Recipes always visible.** Free-tier users see the
  Pro tabs in the sidebar with PRO badges. In-tab locked upsells
  replace the empty chat / goal editor with a sneak-peek of what
  they'd get and a $29 CTA to the Mac App Store. Rationale: you
  can't want what you don't see.
- **AI Assistant renamed Concierge.** More aspirational, less
  utilitarian. The pitch is "your personal download concierge."
- **Themed Ideas panel in Recipes.** 24 starter goals grouped by
  theme (Dev setup, Linux distros, Media, AI + ML, Games, Writing).
  Clickable chips auto-fill the goal field.

## v0.47 — P3 polish + tooltips pass (2026-04-19)

- **Queue → Summary card redesigned.** Hero count (40pt) + state-
  aware subtitle + colour-dot pills + contextual action bar
  (Retry all failed / Clear finished). New `vm.retryAllFailed()`
  method saves click-through after Wi-Fi blips kill a batch.
- **Tooltips pass** — 12 new `.help()` strings on jargon controls.
  "Connections per interface" + ⓘ icon explains the 1–8 trade-off.
  "Per-interface DoH" gets a full paragraph on what DNS-over-HTTPS-
  per-interface actually buys. Metalink / Merkle buttons explain
  file-format semantics.
- **New `labelWithInfo(_:tooltip:)` helper** in DownloadView —
  caption label + small ⓘ icon with hover tooltip. Drop-in for
  future tooltip additions.
- **Dev-override flag for Pro audit.** `splynekDevProUnlocked`
  UserDefaults key bypasses the StoreKit gate in
  splynek-pro/LicenseManager. Lets reviewers + QA test Pro features
  without a real $29 sandbox IAP. Documented in ASC review notes.

## v0.46 — P1 + P2 pre-submission QA (2026-04-19)

P1 bugs (would have earned an App Review rejection):

- **Pause no longer looks cancelled.** Clear errorMessage on the
  paused branch of `DownloadJob.settleAfterRun()`.
- **Phase resets on pause/cancel.** `progress.phase = .pending` on
  every non-completed exit.
- **Trash icon works on paused jobs.** `removeJob()` cancels the
  engine inline and removes regardless of isActive state.
- **Bad-URL error visible.** Moved inline into Source card, below
  Start button. Probe errors get human-actionable hints
  ("HTTP 404 — the file doesn't exist at that URL.").
- **Throughput no longer fantasy GB/s.** Clamped LaneStats window
  divisor to 0.5 s minimum (was 0.001 s).

P2 polish:

- **Phase pills readable.** Icon-only for past/future, icon + label
  for current; `.help()` tooltip on every pill.
- **iPhone USB tether detected + labeled.** New `.iPhoneUSB`
  interface Kind, detected by 172.20.10.0/28 IP range. Icon
  `iphone`, label `iPhone`, cyan tint. Metered for cellular budget.
- **Wi-Fi icon blue (was yellow).** Matches macOS Wi-Fi styling.
- **Queue 3-dots menu enriched.** Retry / Open URL / Copy URL /
  Remove per state (previously often one item → looked empty).
- **Duplicate Start/Queue toolbar buttons removed.** Keyboard
  shortcuts moved to the Source card buttons.
- **Benchmark Run button surfaced inline.** Below the target URL,
  not tucked in the toolbar.
- **History row actions 3 → 2 icons.** Details + Reveal; Quick Look
  in context menu only.
- **Fleet per-file "Stop sharing"** button + persisted exclusion
  list + "Restore all" link.
- **About logo shrunk** 128 → 88 px.

Notarisation shipped:

- Apple Distribution + Developer ID Application certificates in
  keychain.
- `notarytool` keychain profile `AC_PASSWORD` set up.
- DMG re-signed with Developer ID, notarised, stapled, uploaded as
  the GitHub Release asset. No more right-click-to-open dance.
- MAS .pkg built + Apple-Distribution-signed + uploadable via
  Xcode Organizer.

## v0.45 — MAS build infrastructure (2026-04-19)

- **Xcode project** (`project.yml` → `xcodegen generate` → `Splynek.xcodeproj`)
  with two targets: `Splynek` (DMG) + `Splynek-MAS` (sandboxed).
- **Direct-source compilation** in the MAS target: excludes stubs,
  includes sibling private `splynek-pro/Sources/SplynekPro/`. No
  cross-module public-access refactor needed.
- **Sandbox entitlements** (`Resources/Splynek-MAS.entitlements`):
  app-sandbox + network.client + network.server + file pickers +
  bookmarks.app-scope.
- **StoreKit 2 LicenseManager** (in splynek-pro): replaces HMAC with
  Apple-enforced IAP. `Transaction.updates` listener; refund-aware;
  offline-usable via cached entitlements.
- **MAS-specific Pro card** in SettingsView (`#if MAS_BUILD`):
  StoreKit "Buy — $29" + "Restore Purchase" replace the email+key form.
  DMG build's free-tier card now points at the Mac App Store.
- **`#if !MAS_BUILD` guards** on `GlobalHotkey` + `UpdateChecker` —
  both rejected for MAS sandbox; no-op stubs keep call sites clean.
- **Local StoreKit test config** (`Resources/Splynek.storekit`)
  simulates the $29 IAP for dev without submitting to ASC.
- **`Scripts/build-mas.sh`** — one-command MAS archive build with
  prerequisite checks + `Scripts/export-options-mas.plist`.
- **New docs pages**: `docs/support.html`, `docs/privacy.html`,
  `docs/pro.html`. Required URLs for ASC submission.
- **`MAS_LISTING.md`** — copy-paste ASC submission material: 2.2k-char
  description, keywords, review notes, privacy labels, 15-item
  submission checklist.
- Three build paths all pass 117 tests: SPM, Xcode DMG, Xcode MAS.

MAS v1 limitations (tracked for v0.46+): no global hotkey, no
`splynek-cli` helper, no self-update banner, no DMG→MAS data
migration on first launch. DMG users keep all four.

## v0.44 — Public/private split (2026-04-18)

- **Pro code moved to private `Splynek/splynek-pro` repo**: closes
  the bypass vector where anyone could clone the MIT repo and edit
  `isPro = true`. Future Pro features land in the private repo.
- Moved: `LicenseManager`, `AIConcierge`, `AIAssistant`,
  `DownloadRecipe`, `DownloadSchedule`, `ConciergeView`,
  `RecipeView`, `ProLockedView`, `Scripts/gen-license.py`,
  4 test suites.
- **`Sources/SplynekCore/ProStubs.swift`** provides API-compatible
  free-tier stubs: `isPro` always false, AI methods throw,
  schedule always `.allowed`, recipe store is empty no-op.
- Public build compiles identically against stubs; MAS build swaps
  them for real implementations at Xcode-target-exclusion level.
- **`splynek-pro/SANDBOX_AUDIT.md`** — six code changes needed for
  MAS review (global hotkey, CLI, Fleet entitlement, data migration,
  watched folder bookmarks, UpdateChecker).
- Tests: 165 → 117 (48 moved to private repo).
- DMG: 2.5 MB → 2.3 MB (~1,400 LOC lighter).

## v0.43 — QA pass (2026-04-18)

- **P1**: Assistant + Recipes tabs wedged NavigationSplitView (blank
  detail + empty sidebar, full-restart required). Root cause:
  SwiftUI on macOS 14 miscomputes layout when a destination view's
  body has a top-level conditional with structurally different
  subtrees. Fix: move Pro gate to sidebar — tabs don't render for
  free users; "Unlock AI tools" row jumps to Settings.
- **P1**: `RecipeParser.isNonDownloadableHost(...)` rejects App
  Store / iTunes / Play Store / MS Store URLs client-side + prompt
  explicitly forbids them. Was causing silent queue failures.
- Goal text clears after successful recipe generation.
- Queue rows: COMPLETED shows `"took Xs"`, FAILED/CANCELLED hide
  the clock, PENDING/RUNNING keep "added X ago".
- Queue Summary icon: `chart.bar` → `list.clipboard` (was reading
  as Wi-Fi signal strength).
- `formatRelative(_:)` clamps sub-minute to "just now"; forces
  `en_US_POSIX` locale so abbreviations don't mix with
  system-locale connectors.
- Magnet display names: `+` → space before percent decode;
  `%2B` still round-trips as literal `+`.
- `DownloadEngine` reconciles `HostUsage.credit` on completion if
  lane-level crediting undercounted.
- Usage-timeline chart: private IPs render as "LAN (x.x.x.x)".
- Launch-at-login error rewritten to actionable guidance.
- Toolbar `.help(...)` tooltips on every Downloads toolbar button.
- Inline Start / Queue buttons in the Downloads source card.
- 5 new tests + 1 fixture updated. Suite at 165 green.

## v0.42 — Agentic Download Recipes (2026-04-18)

- `DownloadRecipe` + `RecipeItem` — structured plan output from the
  local LLM: name, url, homepage, sha256, sizeHint, rationale,
  confidence (0–1), selected.
- `AIAssistant.generateRecipe(goal:)` — few-shot prompted, JSON-
  formatted, temperature 0.2, 90s timeout. Returns a parsed recipe.
- `RecipeParser` — tolerant of markdown fences + LLM prose; strict
  about URL scheme, required fields, confidence clamping, SHA-256
  format. Invalid items dropped; all-invalid throws `.noItems`.
- `RecipeStore` — persisted recent recipes (capped at 20) under
  `~/Library/Application Support/Splynek/recipes.json`.
- `RecipeView` — new sidebar tab between Assistant and Queue.
  Goal editor + generated checklist + recent-recipes history.
  Pro-gated.
- 19 new tests in `RecipeParserTests`. Suite now at 162 green.
- End-to-end verified against `llama3.2:3b`: 4 items for iOS dev
  setup in 12 s; 3 items for Ubuntu + VS Code + Docker in 7 s.

## v0.41 — Pro license gating (2026-04-18)

- `LicenseValidator` pure offline HMAC-SHA256 key issuance +
  validation. `SPLYNEK-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEE` format.
- `LicenseManager` ObservableObject persists the key + email,
  re-validates on launch, ignores hand-edited invalid persistence.
- `ProLockedView` — reusable paywall card.
- Gates at four call sites: scheduled downloads, AI Concierge, AI
  history search (HistoryView + DownloadView rows), LAN web
  dashboard (FleetCoordinator `proGateForcesLoopback`).
- Splynek Pro settings card at the top of Settings — Buy / activate
  / deactivate flow.
- `Scripts/gen-license.py` — server-side key issuance tool that
  matches Swift byte-for-byte (pinned by a test fixture).
- 13 new tests in `LicenseValidatorTests`. Suite now at 146 green.
- Fleet 2-device cap + MAS StoreKit IAP deferred to v0.42.

## v0.40 — Torrent session restore (2026-04-18)

- `TorrentWriter.preallocate()` is now idempotent — preserves
  existing bytes on disk. Fixes silent partial-progress loss across
  app restarts.
- `PieceVerifier` extracted from `PeerCoordinator.acceptPiece` with
  a `resumeMode` flag. Shared between the swarm and the resume
  scanner.
- `TorrentResume.scan(info:rootDirectory:)` — pure piece-by-piece
  disk verifier returning verified indices + bytes recovered. New
  Sendable-friendly `TorrentWriter.read(...)` static helper so the
  scan dispatches cleanly to a background queue.
- `TorrentEngine.run()` inserts a `"Verifying existing pieces…"`
  phase between announce and swarm. Fully-restored torrents skip
  the swarm entirely and go straight to completion + optional seed.
- Cancel flag polled between pieces so abort is prompt.
- 9 new tests in `TorrentResumeTests`. Suite now at 133 green.

## v0.39 — Finer Gatekeeper signature panel (2026-04-18)

- `GatekeeperDetail` struct + pure `parseDetail(...)` over spctl /
  codesign / stapler merged output. Extracts source, origin,
  authority chain, team ID, CDHash, and notarization-stapled state
  (with nil for offline-inconclusive).
- `evaluateDetail(_:)` async wrapper runs the three tools and
  returns the parsed struct (nil for non-evaluable file types).
- Signature card in HistoryDetailSheet (only for .app/.pkg/.dmg/.mpkg):
  named fields + ACCEPTED / REJECTED pill + raw-output disclosure.
- 7 new tests in `GatekeeperDetailTests` pin the field extraction
  against realistic canned tool outputs.
- Suite now at 124 green.

## v0.38 — Usage timeline chart (2026-04-18)

- `UsageTimeline` — pure data-shaping helpers; top-N hosts across
  the window with alphabetical tiebreak, `"Other"` rollup, today-
  first ordering. Cellular variant splits over-cap days into a
  separate series colour.
- `UsageTimelineView` — SwiftUI Charts stacked bar chart with a
  Host / Cellular segmented picker, a window-days menu (7/14/30/60/90),
  CSV export button. Today's bar draws at full opacity; history at
  0.78.
- Wired into HistoryView between the Lifetime summary and the
  Today-by-host card.
- 10 new tests in `UsageTimelineTests`. Suite now at 117 green.

## v0.37 — CSV export (2026-04-18)

- `HostUsage` + `CellularBudget` now snapshot yesterday's counters
  into per-domain history logs before the midnight roll-over.
  `host-usage-history.json` and `cellular-budget-history.json` both
  cap at 365 days.
- `UsageCSV` — pure RFC 4180 formatter with proper comma / quote /
  newline quoting. Today's state first, history reverse-chronological,
  hosts sorted by bytes desc within a day.
- Export buttons on the Today-by-host card (History view) and the
  cellular budget row (Downloads view). NSSavePanel with dated
  filenames.
- 18 new tests in `UsageCSVTests`. Suite now at 107 green.

## v0.36 — Phase over REST (2026-04-18)

- `LocalState.ActiveJob.phase` — new String field sourced from
  `DownloadProgress.Phase.rawValue`. Exposed on `/splynek/v1/api/jobs`.
- Per-job Combine subscription on `$phase` republishes fleet state on
  each transition so fast loopback downloads don't compress through
  the 2 Hz timer.
- OpenAPI spec lists `phase` as required on ActiveJob with an enum
  of all eight canonical values.
- CLI `splynek status` gains a PHASE column; decodes phase as optional
  so it stays compatible with pre-v0.36 Splyneks.
- `Scripts/integration-test.py` now asserts the phase trail is a
  monotonic subsequence of the canonical pipeline; 100 ms poll.
- 4 new tests in `PhaseOverRESTTests`. Suite now at 94 green.

## v0.35 — Integration tests + Watched folder (2026-04-18)

- `Scripts/integration-test.{sh,py}` — end-to-end REST test: stdlib
  HTTP server → POST `/api/download` → poll jobs + history → SHA-256
  compare. Binds server to primary LAN IP so Splynek's
  `requiredInterface`-pinned outbound request hairpins correctly.
- `WatchedFolder` polled ingester (5 s Timer, 2 s file-age floor)
  with `processed/` move-on-handle. Accepts `.txt` (one URL /
  magnet per line, `#` comments), `.torrent`, `.metalink` / `.meta4`.
- Settings card for watched folder: toggle, folder picker,
  Reveal-in-Finder.
- `watchEnabled` / `watchFolderPath` persist in UserDefaults; init
  resumes the watcher so toggle-on survives restarts.
- 8 new tests in `WatchedFolderTests` for the pure `.txt` parser.
  Suite now at 90 green.

## v0.34 — Scheduled downloads (2026-04-18)

- `DownloadSchedule` model — enabled + start/end hour + weekday set +
  pauseOnCellular. Persisted as `schedule.json`.
- Pure `evaluate(...)` → `.allowed` / `.blocked(reason, nextAllowed)`
  handles simple windows, midnight-wrapping windows, weekday masks,
  and cellular pausing.
- `runNextInQueue()` gates on the schedule; a 60-second retry timer
  wakes the queue automatically when the window opens.
- Settings card with hour pickers, weekday chips (Mon→Sun ordering),
  cellular-pause toggle, and a live "window is open / next opening
  in 3h" status row.
- Queue view badges the head-of-queue entry with WAITING + "Next
  opening in 4h" when the schedule is blocking.
- 16 new tests in `DownloadScheduleTests` pin every evaluator branch
  in a timezone-independent UTC calendar. Suite now at 82 green.

## v0.33 — Torrent Live (2026-04-18)

- `TorrentLiveCard` on the Live dashboard: 72-pt throughput headline,
  canonical six-phase pipeline strip (announcing → fetchingMetadata →
  connecting → downloading → seeding → done), pieces / peers metrics,
  ENDGAME + SEEDING pills, inline seeding strip (port / leechers /
  uploaded / uptime), cancel control.
- `TorrentLivePhase.infer(...)` — pure phase-mapper collapsing the
  engine's freeform `progress.phase` strings (plus piece/finished/
  seeding state) onto the pill set; fully unit-tested.
- `TorrentRateSampler` — 1-Hz sampler over an 8 s rolling window
  derives a smoothed bytes/sec from `progress.downloaded` deltas.
- Live view empty state now keys on HTTP + torrent activity jointly.
- 10 new tests in `LiveTorrentPhaseTests`; suite now at 66 green.

## v0.27 — Platform pass (2026-04-17)

- Documented REST API at `/splynek/v1/api/*` with embedded OpenAPI
  3.1 spec at `/splynek/v1/openapi.yaml`.
- `splynek` CLI binary (new SPM target `splynek-cli`) with
  `download`, `queue`, `status`, `history`, `cancel`, `openapi`,
  `version` subcommands.
- Raycast extension (`Extensions/Raycast/`) — three commands.
- Alfred workflow (`Extensions/Alfred/`) — `dl`, `dlq`, `dlstatus`.
- Three new App Intents: `CancelAllDownloads`, `PauseAllDownloads`,
  `ListRecentHistory`.
- AI history search — natural-language query via Ollama, ranks
  entries by relevance.
- Benchmark panel *Save image…* button — 1200×630 PNG OG-card.
- Distribution: `Scripts/dmg.sh` for DMG build; Homebrew cask
  template at `Packaging/splynek.rb`; `LANDING.md` + `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Fleet descriptor (`~/Library/Application Support/Splynek/fleet.json`)
  written on listener-bind so the CLI / Raycast / Alfred discover
  port + token without env-var plumbing.

## v0.26 — Credibility sprint

- Self-hosted test runner (no XCTest dep); 47 tests across Merkle,
  Bencode, magnet parsing, BEP 52 verification, duplicate
  detection, sanitization, web dashboard, QR codes.
